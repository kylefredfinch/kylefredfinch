- 👋 Hi, I’m @kylefredfinch
- 👀 I’m interested in learning JavaScript foundations and eventually the MERN technologies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JS fundamentals on Udemy, and an intensive React.js bootcamp on Kent C. Dodds courses.
- 💞️ I’m looking for any advice, be small or large. Any help will go a long way when everything is new.
- 📫 My email address is kyle.fred.finch@gmail.com
